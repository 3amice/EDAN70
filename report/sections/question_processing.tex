\subsection{Preprocessing of questions}
Given a question, the system will first of all convert the question
to a format which can be used to perform a query to the indexed
database. This is done by simply whitelisting all characters which
aren not in our supported swedish alphabet. The question is also
used to determine the category of our answers.

\subsection{Training the Question Categorizer}
The training set used to predict the category of the questions
are 3300 questions from the swedish board game.
