This project is a proof-of-concept of a swedish question answering system, similiar to IBM Watson.
The goal is to create a system that is able to answer simple questions with one word long answers.
To do this, the swedish wikipedia was used as data source, and annotated questions from the swedish 
board game Kvitt eller dubbelt was used as training questions and categories.

A system overview is shown in figure \ref{fig:overview}.
